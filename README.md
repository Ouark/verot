### What is it?

An example will be more useful than any blurb I can write :

    ```php
    $foo = new Upload($_FILES['form_field']);
    if ($foo->uploaded) {
        // save uploaded image with no changes
        $foo->Process('/home/user/files/');
        if ($foo->processed) {
            echo 'original image copied';
        } else {
            echo 'error : ' . $foo->error;
        }
        // save uploaded image with a new name
        $foo->file_new_name_body = 'foo';
        $foo->Process('/home/user/files/');
        if ($foo->processed) {
        echo 'image renamed "foo" copied';
        } else {
        echo 'error : ' . $foo->error;
        }
        // save uploaded image with a new name,
        // resized to 100px wide
        $foo->file_new_name_body = 'image_resized';
        $foo->image_resize = true;
        $foo->image_convert = gif;
        $foo->image_x = 100;
        $foo->image_ratio_y = true;
        $foo->Process('/home/user/files/');
        if ($foo->processed) {
            echo 'image renamed, resized x=100
                  and converted to GIF';
            $foo->Clean();
        } else {
            echo 'error : ' . $foo->error;
        }
    }
    ```

### What does it actually do in this example?

This example uses a file uploaded via a form. With this single file, it will :

* copy the file without any modification
* copy the file after having changed its name to 'foo'
* copy the file, resizing it to x=100, y=auto, converting it to GIF

### How does it work?

* the class constructor _upload_ handles a uploaded file (it can also handle a local file)
* some optional parameters can be set up to act on the file during the _process_
* the process is called with as an argument the destination directory on the server. If some parameters have been set up, the class will rename, resize, convert files and images
* when the uploaded file is not needed anymore, we can delete it using _clean_.

### Why use this class?

* with one uploaded file, you can do as many copies, convertions, resizing you want.
* you can resize each image dimension, or both, keeping the image ratio or not.
* you can choose to resize an image only if it is bigger -or smaller- than the wanted sizes
* you can manipulate the image in many ways, play with colors, add borders, labels and watermarks...
* its use is simplistic but powerful
* you can work on uploaded files or local files, useful for batch processing
* Flash uploaders are fully supported
* MIME type detection is very comprehensive
* more than 60 documented configuration settings
* a lot of variables are set up during the process. You can retrieve all these values after a process.
* error messages are understandable, and a variable log allows you to see what the class does.
* it is translated in more than 25 languages
* it is already widely used on Internet
* it is free :)
